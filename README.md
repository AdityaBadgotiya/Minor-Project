# MINOR-PROJECT
# Accident Detection and Real-Time Driver Drowsiness System

## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort aimed at enhancing road safety. We have developed an accident detection model using a video dataset and YOLOv8, and a real-time driver drowsiness detection system in Python.

## Features
1. **Accident Detection**: Utilizes a video dataset and the YOLOv8 model to detect accidents. The model has been trained to recognize various types of accidents and can alert authorities in real-time.
2. **Driver Drowsiness Detection**: Monitors the driver in real-time using a webcam. The system can detect signs of drowsiness or inattention, and can alert the driver or stop the vehicle to prevent accidents.

## Prerequisites
